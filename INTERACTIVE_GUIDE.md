# Interactive Tutorial Guide for Students

Welcome to the **First Datasette App** interactive tutorial! This guide will help you get the most out of learning with an AI assistant.

## What Makes This Tutorial Interactive?

Unlike traditional tutorials where you simply follow steps, this tutorial is designed as a **challenging conversation between you and an AI assistant** (Claude Code or GitHub Copilot). The AI will:

- ✅ Ask you questions to check your understanding
- ✅ Guide you to discover concepts on your own
- ✅ Help you troubleshoot when you get stuck
- ✅ Encourage you to make design decisions
- ✅ Challenge you with substantive exercises that require real thinking
- ✅ Push you to apply concepts to realistic journalism scenarios
- ✅ Help you develop professional-level data skills

**This tutorial is designed to be challenging.** You'll be asked to think critically, solve problems independently, and synthesize concepts across multiple areas. The goal isn't just to complete the steps—it's to develop skills you can apply to real data journalism projects.

## Getting Started

## How the AI Will Guide You

### Interactive Checkpoints

Throughout the tutorial, you'll see sections like this:

> **🤔 Interactive Checkpoint**
>
> Before you begin: Discuss with your AI assistant...

When you see these:
1. **Don't skip them!** They're designed to deepen your understanding
2. **Ask your AI assistant** the questions listed
3. **Share your thoughts** - there are no wrong answers at this stage
4. **Discuss** until you feel ready to move forward

### Types of Interactions

**🤔 Think First**: Before running a command, predict what will happen
- Example: "Before running `git status`, ask your AI what you expect to see"

**💭 Pause and Discuss**: Explore concepts before learning about them
- Example: "What do you think 'version control' means?"

**💬 Design Decisions**: Make choices and discuss the reasoning
- Example: "What should you name your database? Why?"

**🔍 Troubleshooting**: When errors occur, work through them together
- Example: "What does this error message tell you?"

**🎯 Deep Dive Challenges**: Substantial exercises that push your understanding
- Example: "Perform a complete data type audit and create a transformation plan"
- These require independent research, experimentation, and problem-solving
- Don't expect quick answers—struggle is part of learning

**📝 Substantive Reflections**: Written assignments requiring synthesis and application
- Example: "Design a Git workflow for a data journalism project"
- These require you to connect concepts and think about real-world application
- Discuss thoroughly with your AI assistant before moving on

**🚀 Extension Activities**: Optional challenges for those who want to go deeper
- Example: "Deploy your Datasette instance to a cloud platform"
- These are for students who want professional-level skills

**✅ Comprehension Checks**: Verify your understanding at the end of each act
- Example: "Can you explain what we learned in your own words?"

## Embracing the Challenge

This tutorial is intentionally challenging. Here's why and how to approach it:

### Why Challenges Matter

- **Real journalism is hard**: The skills you need to investigate stories with data require practice
- **Struggle builds understanding**: When you work through difficulties, concepts stick better
- **Professional preparation**: These challenges mirror real-world data journalism tasks

### How to Approach Challenges

1. **Try first, ask second**: Attempt each challenge before asking for help
2. **Document your attempts**: Write down what you tried and what happened
3. **Embrace confusion**: Feeling stuck is a sign you're learning something new
4. **Use multiple resources**: Documentation, web searches, and your AI assistant
5. **Reflect on solutions**: After solving something, ask "Why did this work?"

### The Productive Struggle Zone

You should feel challenged but not hopeless. If you're:
- **Breezing through**: Ask your AI for additional challenges
- **Completely stuck**: Ask for hints, not answers
- **Frustrated**: Take a break, then return with fresh eyes

## Tips for Success

### Do's ✅

- **Ask questions freely**: If you don't understand something, ask!
- **Explain your thinking**: The AI learns how to help you better when you share your thought process
- **Experiment**: Try things! The AI can help you recover from mistakes
- **Take your time**: Learning is more important than speed
- **Engage with challenges seriously**: They're where professional skills are built
- **Be honest about confusion**: It's better to ask than to pretend you understand
- **Take notes**: Document what you learn for future reference
- **Connect concepts**: Ask how ideas relate to previous acts and real journalism

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't skip the challenges**: They're where the deep learning happens
- **Don't just copy commands**: Understand what each command does
- **Don't rush**: This isn't a race
- **Don't be afraid of errors**: They're learning opportunities
- **Don't work in silence**: Keep the conversation going with your AI assistant
- **Don't accept answers without understanding**: Always ask "why?" and "how?"
- **Don't settle for surface understanding**: Push until concepts are clear

## Example Interactions

### Good Interaction Example

**You**: "I'm ready to start Act 1!"

**AI**: "Great! Before we begin Act 1: Hello Codespaces, let me ask you a few questions. What do you hope to learn from this tutorial? And have you used Git or version control before?"

**You**: "I want to learn how to publish data on the web. I've heard of Git but never used it."

**AI**: "Perfect! That's exactly what we'll do. Git is a version control system that helps you track changes to your code. Think of it like 'track changes' in Microsoft Word, but much more powerful. What do you think might be useful about tracking changes to code?"

**You**: "Maybe so you can go back if you make a mistake? Or see what you changed?"

**AI**: "Exactly right! Those are two of the main benefits. Now let's get started with the Codespaces environment..."

### Less Effective Interaction Example

**You**: "I'm ready to start."

**AI**: "Great! Before we begin Act 1, have you used Git before?"

**You**: "No. What's the first command?"

**AI**: "Let me explain what Git is first. It's important to understand..."

**You**: "Just tell me what to type."

*[This approach misses the learning opportunities!]*

## Working Through Each Act

Each of the 5 acts follows a similar pattern:

1. **Introduction**: Discuss what you'll learn
2. **Exploration**: Try things and make predictions
3. **Implementation**: Run commands and build your project
4. **Understanding**: Explain concepts in your own words
5. **Reflection**: Summarize what you learned

### Typical Act Flow

```
Start Act
    ↓
Discuss goals and concepts
    ↓
Make predictions about what will happen
    ↓
Run commands and observe results
    ↓
Discuss what happened
    ↓
Troubleshoot any issues (with AI help)
    ↓
Reflect on what you learned
    ↓
Complete Act → Move to next
```

## Getting Help

### When You're Stuck

If you're confused or stuck:

1. **Tell your AI assistant**: "I'm stuck on this part. Can you help me understand?"
2. **Ask for clarification**: "Can you explain what X means?"
3. **Request examples**: "Can you give me an example of when this would be useful?"
4. **Ask for hints**: "Can you give me a hint without telling me the answer?"

### When You Get Errors

Don't panic! Errors are normal and valuable:

1. **Read the error message** carefully
2. **Discuss with your AI**: "I got this error. What do you think it means?"
3. **Work through it together**: The AI will guide you to solve it
4. **Learn from it**: Understanding errors makes you a better developer

**Remember**: The goal isn't to finish quickly - it's to develop professional-level skills!

## Assessment and Understanding

Throughout the tutorial, the AI will check your understanding through questions. These aren't tests - they're learning tools! The AI uses your answers to:

- Identify areas where you might need more explanation
- Adjust the pace to match your learning
- Ensure you're building on solid understanding
- Help you connect concepts together

## After the Tutorial

When you complete the tutorial:

1. **Complete the Capstone Project**: This is the most important part—apply everything you've learned to a real project proposal
2. **Review your work**: Look back at what you've built and the challenges you completed
3. **Final reflection**: Use the comprehensive reflection checklist to verify your understanding
4. **Execute your capstone**: Consider actually building the project you proposed
5. **Share your learning**: Help classmates, write about what you learned, or contribute to the Datasette community

### Continuing Your Learning

The tutorial introduces you to several pathways for continued growth:
- **Data Engineering**: Build automated data pipelines
- **Data Visualization**: Create compelling charts and graphics
- **Investigative Methods**: Develop source-finding and verification skills
- **Advanced Programming**: Deepen Python and SQL expertise
- **Cloud Deployment**: Learn to publish and maintain production applications

Discuss with your AI assistant which pathway aligns with your career goals.

## Troubleshooting the Interactive Experience

### "The AI isn't asking me questions"

- Make sure the AI has read the `Claude.md` file
- Remind the AI: "Please use the interactive teaching style from Claude.md"
- Reference the interactive checkpoints in docs/index.rst

### "I just want the answers"

- Remember: Explaining concepts helps you learn them better
- The Socratic method (learning through questions) is proven effective
- You'll retain more if you think through problems rather than just copying solutions

### "This is taking too long"

- It's okay to take breaks!
- Learning deeply takes time
- You can save your progress and come back later (it's all saved in Git!)
