# Interactive Tutorial Guide for Students

Welcome to the **First Datasette App** interactive tutorial! This guide will help you get the most out of learning with an AI assistant.

## What Makes This Tutorial Interactive?

Unlike traditional tutorials where you simply follow steps, this tutorial is designed as a **challenging conversation between you and an AI assistant** (Claude Code or GitHub Copilot). The AI will:

- ✅ Ask you questions to check your understanding
- ✅ Guide you to discover concepts on your own
- ✅ Help you troubleshoot when you get stuck
- ✅ Challenge you with substantive exercises that require real thinking
- ✅ Push you to apply concepts to realistic journalism scenarios
- ✅ Help you develop professional-level data journalism skills

**This tutorial is designed to be challenging.** You'll be asked to think critically, solve problems independently, and connect technical skills to real reporting work. The goal isn't just to complete the steps—it's to develop skills you can use on your next story.

## Moving at Your Own Pace

This tutorial adapts to your experience level:

- **New to command-line tools?** The AI will explain concepts and check your understanding
- **Already comfortable?** Tell your AI assistant "I'm familiar with [topic]" and skip to the challenges
- **Want to move fast?** Say "Let's move quickly" and the AI will focus on the advanced content

You can skip any section you're comfortable with. The real learning is in the **Deep Dive Challenges** and **Reflection Assignments** - those are designed to push everyone, regardless of experience level.

## Tutorial Overview

Here's what you'll learn in each act:

- **Act 1: Hello sqlite-utils** - Loading data, command-line queries, export formats, data maintenance
  - *Challenges*: Quick data profiling, command-line SQL, data extraction, ongoing updates
- **Act 2: Hello Datasette** - Web publishing, full-text search, enrichments, API capabilities
  - *Challenges*: Search strategy design, enrichment pipelines, API applications, publication ethics
- **Act 3: Exploring Data for Stories** - Facets, filters, SQL, finding news
  - *Challenges*: Story pitching, accountability queries, enterprise investigations, public service tools

## Expected Time

- **Core tutorial**: 2-3 hours (completing the basic steps and interactive checkpoints)
- **With challenges**: 4-5 hours (completing Deep Dive Challenges and Substantive Reflections)
- **Full experience**: 5-6+ hours (including Extension Activities and Capstone Project)

**Important**: The challenges are where the real learning happens. Don't skip them just to "finish" faster. A journalist who deeply understands these tools will be far more effective than one who rushed through.

## How the AI Will Guide You

### Interactive Checkpoints

Throughout the tutorial, you'll see sections like this:

> **🤔 Interactive Checkpoint**
>
> Before you begin: Discuss with your AI assistant...

When you see these:
1. **Don't skip them!** They're designed to deepen your understanding
2. **Ask your AI assistant** the questions listed
3. **Share your thoughts** - there are no wrong answers at this stage
4. **Discuss** until you feel ready to move forward

### Types of Interactions

**🤔 Think First**: Before running a command, predict what will happen
- Example: "Before running this query, what results do you expect?"

**💭 Pause and Discuss**: Explore concepts before learning about them
- Example: "What do you think 'publishing' data means?"

**🔍 Troubleshooting**: When errors occur, work through them together
- Example: "What does this error message tell you?"

**🎯 Deep Dive Challenges**: Substantial exercises that push your understanding
- Example: "Find THREE potential news stories in this data"
- These require independent research, experimentation, and journalism thinking
- Don't expect quick answers—struggle is part of learning

**📝 Substantive Reflections**: Written assignments requiring synthesis and application
- Example: "Design a search strategy for reporters using this Datasette"
- These require you to connect concepts and think about real-world application
- Discuss thoroughly with your AI assistant before moving on

**🚀 Extension Activities**: Optional challenges for those who want to go deeper
- Example: "Add geographic enrichment to enable mapping"
- These are for students who want professional-level skills

**✅ Comprehension Checks**: Verify your understanding at the end of each act
- Example: "When would you use sqlite-utils vs. opening Excel?"

## Embracing the Challenge

This tutorial is intentionally challenging. Here's why and how to approach it:

### Why Challenges Matter

- **Real journalism is hard**: Finding stories in data requires practice
- **Struggle builds understanding**: When you work through difficulties, concepts stick better
- **Professional preparation**: These challenges mirror real newsroom tasks

### How to Approach Challenges

1. **Try first, ask second**: Attempt each challenge before asking for help
2. **Think like a journalist**: Ask "what's the story?" at every step
3. **Embrace confusion**: Feeling stuck is a sign you're learning something new
4. **Verify your findings**: Real journalists don't trust their first result
5. **Reflect on solutions**: After solving something, ask "how would I use this?"

### The Productive Struggle Zone

You should feel challenged but not hopeless. If you're:
- **Breezing through**: Ask your AI for additional challenges
- **Completely stuck**: Ask for hints, not answers
- **Frustrated**: Take a break, then return with fresh eyes

## Tips for Success

### Do's ✅

- **Set your own pace**: Tell the AI if you want to move faster or slower
- **Skip what you know**: If you're comfortable with a topic, say so and move on
- **Ask questions freely**: If you don't understand something, ask!
- **Experiment**: Try things! The AI can help you recover from mistakes
- **Focus on challenges**: The Deep Dive Challenges are where real learning happens
- **Be honest about confusion**: It's better to ask than to pretend you understand
- **Think about stories**: The data has stories—your job is to find them

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't skip the challenges**: They're where the deep learning happens
- **Don't just copy commands**: Understand what each command does
- **Don't rush**: This isn't a race
- **Don't be afraid of errors**: They're learning opportunities
- **Don't work in silence**: Keep the conversation going with your AI assistant
- **Don't accept answers without understanding**: Always ask "why?" and "how?"
- **Don't forget verification**: A pattern isn't a story until you've checked it

## Example Interactions

### Good Interaction Example

**You**: "I'm ready to start Act 1!"

**AI**: "Great! Before we begin with sqlite-utils, let me ask you a few questions. Why do you think a journalist might want to query data from the command line instead of opening Excel?"

**You**: "Maybe it's faster? Or you could automate it?"

**AI**: "Exactly right! Speed is crucial in a newsroom. Let's say your editor asks 'how many grants went to universities last year?' With sqlite-utils, you can answer that in seconds without even opening a spreadsheet. Let's see how..."

### Less Effective Interaction Example

**You**: "I'm ready to start."

**AI**: "Great! Before we begin, why might command-line tools be useful for journalists?"

**You**: "I don't know. What's the first command?"

**AI**: "Let me explain why this matters first..."

**You**: "Just tell me what to type."

*[This approach misses the learning opportunities!]*

## Working Through Each Act

Each of the 3 acts follows a similar pattern:

1. **Introduction**: Discuss what you'll learn and why it matters for journalism
2. **Exploration**: Try things and make predictions
3. **Implementation**: Run commands and build your project
4. **Challenges**: Push your understanding with substantive exercises
5. **Reflection**: Connect what you learned to real reporting

### Typical Act Flow

```

```

## Getting Help

### When You're Stuck

If you're confused or stuck:

1. **Tell your AI assistant**: "I'm stuck on this part. Can you help me understand?"
2. **Ask for clarification**: "Can you explain what X means?"
3. **Request examples**: "Can you give me a journalism example of when this would be useful?"
4. **Ask for hints**: "Can you give me a hint without telling me the answer?"

### When You Get Errors

Don't panic! Errors are normal and valuable:

1. **Read the error message** carefully
2. **Discuss with your AI**: "I got this error. What do you think it means?"
3. **Work through it together**: The AI will guide you to solve it
4. **Learn from it**: Understanding errors makes you a better data journalist

## Assessment and Understanding

Throughout the tutorial, the AI will check your understanding through questions. These aren't tests - they're learning tools! The AI uses your answers to:

- Identify areas where you might need more explanation
- Adjust the pace to match your learning
- Ensure you're building on solid understanding
- Help you connect concepts to journalism practice

## After the Tutorial

When you complete the tutorial:

1. **Complete the Capstone Project**: This is the most important part—apply everything you've learned to a real project proposal
2. **Review your work**: Look back at what you've built and the challenges you completed
3. **Final reflection**: Use the skills checklist to verify your understanding
4. **Execute your capstone**: Consider actually building the project you proposed
5. **Share your learning**: Help classmates, write about what you learned, or contribute to the Datasette community

### Continuing Your Learning

The tutorial introduces you to pathways for continued growth:
- **More SQL**: Practice with complex queries, window functions, CTEs
- **More Datasette**: Explore the plugin ecosystem, deployment options
- **Data Journalism**: Learn verification methods, FOIA/public records, source development
- **Visualization**: Learn to tell visual stories with data

Discuss with your AI assistant which pathway aligns with your career goals.

## Troubleshooting the Interactive Experience

### "The AI isn't asking me questions"

- Make sure the AI has read the `Claude.md` file
- Remind the AI: "Please use the interactive teaching style from Claude.md"
- Reference the interactive checkpoints in docs/index.rst

### "I just want the answers"

- Remember: Explaining concepts helps you learn them better
- The Socratic method (learning through questions) is proven effective
- You'll retain more if you think through problems rather than just copying solutions

### "This is taking too long"

- It's okay to take breaks!
- Learning deeply takes time
- You can save your progress and come back later

## Tips from Past Students

> "At first I wanted to just rush through, but when I slowed down and really engaged with the challenges, I understood so much more!"

> "Don't be embarrassed to ask 'dumb questions' - the AI never judges and the explanations really helped."

> "The story-finding challenges were hard, but they forced me to actually think like a journalist instead of just clicking buttons."

> "Making mistakes and working through errors with the AI taught me more than getting everything right the first time."

> "The capstone project made me realize I could actually do data journalism. It brought everything together."

> "I spent extra time on the SQL challenges and now I use those skills every week in my reporting."

## Quick Reference

### Key Commands

```bash
# Load data
sqlite-utils insert database.db tablename data.csv --csv

# Append new data (skip duplicates)
sqlite-utils insert database.db tablename new_data.csv --csv --ignore

# Query from command line
sqlite-utils database.db "SELECT * FROM tablename LIMIT 10"

# Export data
sqlite-utils database.db "SELECT * FROM tablename" --csv > output.csv

# Enable full-text search
sqlite-utils enable-fts database.db tablename column1 column2

# Start Datasette
datasette serve database.db

# Start with CORS enabled (for API access from other sites)
datasette serve database.db --cors

# Install plugins
datasette install plugin-name
```

### API Endpoints

```text
# JSON data (add .json to any table URL)
/database/tablename.json

# With filters
/database/tablename.json?column__gt=1000

# SQL query as JSON
/database.json?sql=SELECT+*+FROM+tablename+LIMIT+10

# CSV export
/database/tablename.csv
```

### Useful SQL Patterns

```sql
-- Count records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tablename;

-- Group and aggregate
SELECT column, COUNT(*), SUM(amount)
FROM tablename
GROUP BY column;

-- Find outliers
SELECT * FROM tablename
WHERE amount > (SELECT AVG(amount) * 3 FROM tablename);

-- Top N by group
SELECT * FROM tablename
ORDER BY amount DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Story-Finding Questions
